## Overview

This project is part of the course "Deep Learning: Architectures & Methods" offered by the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Lab at TU Darmstadt. The repository includes implementations of deep learning models such as feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, autoencoders, and variational autoencoders from scratch using NumPy or PyTorch.

## Task1
